  <p>
    I really enjoyed all the various metaphors the readings used 
    to describe websites. They made websites out to be not just a 
    technical object or portfolio, but as a living, expressive space.
    I was especially drawn to the garden or puddle metaphor, which 
    suggests that websites can grow, change, or even disappear over 
    time. Additionally, a website doesnâ€™t need to be perfect or 
    permanent; it just needs to reflect myself and the content in a 
    meaningful way. In a digital world dominated by capitalism and corporations, 
    being able to express oneself through the web feels almost nostalgic, 
    especially when considering how much the web has changed 
    since I was little.
