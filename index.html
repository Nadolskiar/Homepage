        <h3> Reading discussion one: </h3>
        <h4> 08/31/25 </h4>
        I really enjoyed all the various metaphors the readings used 
        to describe websites. They made websites out to be not just a 
        technical object or portfolio, but as a living, expressive space.
         I was especially drawn to the garden or puddle metaphor, which 
         suggests that websites can grow, change, or even disappear over 
         time. Additionally, a website doesnâ€™t need to be perfect or 
         permanent; it just needs to reflect myself/the content in a 
         meaningful way. In a digital world dominated by capatalism and corporate, 
         being able to express oneself through the web f eels almost nostalgic,
        especially when considering how much the web has changed 
          since I was little.
