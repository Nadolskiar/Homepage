I really enjoyed all the various metaphors the readings used to describe websites. They made websites out to be not just a technical object or portfolio, but as a living, expressive space. I was especially drawn to the garden or puddle metaphor, which suggests that websites can grow, change, or even disappear over time. Additionally, a website doesn’t need to be perfect or permanent; it just needs to reflect myself/the content in a meaningful way. In a digital world dominated by corporate platforms, being able to express oneself through the web feels almost nostalgic, especially when considering how much the web has changed since I was little.

“The Internet's Back-to-the-Land Movement" highlights how bad cycles such as overconsumption and environmental neglect are perpetuated by large-scale industrial and digital systems. Even though our world has been built upon these systems for decades, small-scale, self-sufficient production models offer a meaningful alternative. While organizations like the Club of Rome recognized the dangers of unchecked growth, their proposed solutions ultimately protected existing hierarchies rather than challenging the corporate systems driving ecological collapse. In contrast, the small-scale movements that emerged in response. The back-to-the-land communities, Masanobu Fukuoka’s natural farming, and today’s “low-tech” digital experiments represent genuine efforts to live within ecological limits. Large corporations make up the majority, if not all, of the world’s waste, pollution, and environmental destruction. While individuals are often blamed or encouraged to make small lifestyle changes, the real damage does come from large-scale industrial production, resource extraction, and profit-driven practices; but by rejecting mass industrial and digital systems built on exploitation, these alternative models (mentioned in the reading) help us imagine a future rooted in restraint, balance, and environmental consciousness rather than greed and endless expansion. These examples help show us that true sustainability can not be achieved through corporate-managed “green” solutions, but through decentralization, community-led production, and a reconnection with natural processes.

My biggest takeaway from this reading is the need and usage for third-party spaces today. In an era of ever-expanding, corruptive technology we lose slow and meaningful engagements with not only our spaces but people as well. The web used to have proper third spaces, places where people could go for a short amount of time to learn, socialize, and create. This of course was before social media began controlling our lives and attention spans in almost every aspect. Though social media gives us the ability to communicate and share information rapidly with one another, it impacts our third-party spaces. Spontaneous conversations, chance meetings, and genuine new connections seem to be becoming more rare. We as a collective have become less vulnerable in public, unable to disconnect and truly be aware of our surroundings, and have isolated ourselves from each other. To truly appreciate our spaces, surroundings, and environment we must learn to truly disconnect, which seems impossible as of late especially since we rely on our phones and technology in so many aspects. From paying with digital wallets, taking photos, to reading the news–we have truly adapted as a society to utilize our phones as much as possible. I try to stay away from my phone throughout the day, especially if I'm in a social, educational, and spiritual setting, I genuinely enjoy observing and participating, and believe that our phones truly take away from the important, subtle moments in our lives.
