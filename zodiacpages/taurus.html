          <div class="right-box box5">Taurus: <br> <br> Your essential purpose in life is to maintain the stability of Earthly things, and so you have a highly developed sense of earthly harmony and wholesomeness - and you know and feel what appeals to the senses. Your sign is common amongst the artistically talented. Another on of your virtues is the ability to endure change, while at the same time conserving those habits and traditions that are so important to a healthy and wholesome physcial life. You have to be careful not to let this talent become blunted into a mere ability to resist change when it is good, otherwise one day you would find change foisted upon you in a rather non-negotiable way. Your broad Taurean back can carry more than you sometimes believe. <br> Your sensuality - possibly your defining feature - has little trouble attracting sex or attention. Where it can go wrong is in failing to appreciate the more psychological dimension of life, giving rise to not seeing and catering to your own or someone else's more intangible needs. It could also find you being assailed by something that you couldn't just stubbornly resist, or find you having to provide for more than you could afford, either materially or emotionally, <br> Ultimately, as a Taurean you have to discover your trust, deepest and highest values. This is symbolized by ascending terraces of sweeter and sweeter clover. When you know what is truly valuable, you are no longer chained to people and things that are concerned with lesser values. And the greated indication of value is beauty - either touvhed, heard or seen. And this cannot really be owned, only appreciated and created - a talent essentially.</div>
