          <div class="right-box box5">Capricorn: <br> Your essential purpose in life is to establidh a material position in the world that you regard as usefu. IN order to accomplish this you have an innate sense of ambition and organization. You make a point of knowing how the world of politics and business works - along with anything else whuch your canny mind determines as being practical and relevant to your overall intentions. <br> Such earthly common sense is something that others depend on you for - nd at times can feel rather inadequate in comparison to. However, your weakness is that you tend to overlook or simply not see matters of emotional signifigance , which are patently obious to types less pragmatic than yourself. <br> SO although you are more likely than most to achieve some sort of sucess in the world. as a result of your industriousness, you are at some point more than likely to encounter a collapse or a profound sense of pointlessness because you have only taken into consideration the practical side of life, and underestimated the importance of unseens factors like human longings and weakness, and the mystery if life itself. When your sense of what matter begins to include these more invisible and mystical aspects of existence, upi then become the true organizer that you were born to be. When you apply your worldly, responsible and hard-workng nature, to making a sound base for your the furtherance of collective ot spiritual interests, then you truly feel that you are the sucess, which you originally thought you would be.  </div>
