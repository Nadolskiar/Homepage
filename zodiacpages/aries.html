      Aries: <br><br>
      Your essential purpose in life is simply to do something that makes you feel 
      an independent and effective individual. At heart you are a pioneer, a 
      champion of the underdog, the warrior — so therefore you must find a cause 
      to fight for in life. As an Aries, you need to point yourself in a definite 
      direction. In doing so you will encounter adversaries, but it is through 
      them that you can discover your cause. In other words you have to push. 
      If you don’t you will find others pushing you instead. You are egocentric 
      and see life as an extension of yourself. This can appear to others as 
      headstrong or selfish; but it is also what makes you able to act, rather 
      than just think about acting. Aries is the sign of the leader. It is the 
      first sign and it likes to be first. If you do not have a competitive spirit 
      then you probably have a fairly strong fear of failure and a lack of 
      self-worth, possibly born of bad experiences of someone else's assertiveness, 
      such as violence, anger, or abuse, that have occurred in your life. If such 
      is the case, championing those similarly abused could be the cause for you. 
      Seeing that independence is what Aries is largely about, convoluted emotions 
      such as self-pity and resentment should be ruthlessly weeded out for such 
      deny you your essential nature and right, which is straightforward. This 
      right is like the outpouring of life itself, and nothing should be allowed 
      to get in the way of its innocence and freshness, for this is what enables 
      your sign, like no other, to set the ball rolling.
