          <div class="right-box box5">Scorpio: <br> Your essential purpose in life is to deepen and make more genuine whatever is is that you regard as important. To enable you to accomplish this you bave an ability to see into the heart and soul of a person or situation, and to heal or transform what you find there. The response that you get to this insight of yours varies. You can elivit from other extremes or mistrust or devotion, and consequently be either mistrustful or utterly devoted yourself. Your probing intensity can certainly reach the parts that other signs cannot reach. But if you wish to not emotionally exhaust those people who matter to you, give the probing a break occasionally , for the world will get by for a while with out it. This ability of yours to penetrate into another emotional reality is secually based. This means to say that Scorpios renowned sexuality is more to do with your mind and feelings than your body. This is what sets you apart from other signs, for you are able to 'enter' someone else's space without touching them. This psychological insight, and the powerful influence that it can weild, is compromised by one thing only: you suspect that others are doing the same to you with dubious intentions. This in turn gives rise to a downward spiral of discord that appears to proveyour supicious correct. Behind all this is your fear of having to clink in your armour - your vulnerability - spotted and taken advantage of. Spot yourself first, and you are invulnerable. </div>
