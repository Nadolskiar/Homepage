        <h1> Aries is a Mars-ruled Cardinal Fire sign and the first 
            sign of the zodiac. Aries is known for initiation and 
            independence. Symbolized by the ram, Aries moves quickly
             and suddenly. It sprints forward without holding back, 
             fueled by passion and inspiration. Aries is innovative, 
             being the first to take action with the willingness to take risks. 
             The desire to go first and be first makes Aries competitive. Its 
             quick movements mean that it has to think on its feet and be decisive. 
             As a cardinal sign, Aries is quick to take off but struggles to maintain 
             its speed, leading to burnout. Aries can also decide on things too quickly, 
             leaving no time for analysis or debates.</h1>
