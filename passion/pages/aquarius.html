        <h1>Aquarius is a Saturn-ruled Fixed Air sign and the eleventh sign of the zodiac. Aquarius is characterized by intelligence and innovation. Symbolized by the water bearer, it aims to control what direction the collective moves in. Aquarius looks to the unknown, trying to figure out the rules that govern things we don’t understand. It goes against the status quo with the desire to create a new one, focusing on how things can work differently from what people are used to. Aquarius is also rigid in its desire for change, making it difficult to shift its perspective after it has settled on a new normal.</h1>
