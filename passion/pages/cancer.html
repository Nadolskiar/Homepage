        <h1> Cancer is a Moon-ruled Cardinal Water sign and the fourth sign of the zodiac. Cancer is known for cultivation and protection. Symbolized by the crab, Cancer defends that which is essential and exposed. It walks sideways, approaching issues indirectly. Cancer is tuned to safety and tries to tie itself to others in order to establish a place for itself. Cancer nurtures people while also seeking out nurturance. It’s emotionally generous in its nature, offering space and support for others when they need it. Tuned to the cycles of the moon, Cancer is prone to fluctuation. It can also manipulate emotions when it feels unsafe.</h1>
