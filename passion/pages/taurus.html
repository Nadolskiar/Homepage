        <h1>Taurus is a Venus-ruled Fixed Earth sign and the second sign of the zodiac. Taurus is characterized by permanence and sensuality. Symbolized by the bull, Taurus gets things done slowly and methodically. Its pace makes it gravitate towards things that stay the same. Ruled by Venus, Taurus is concerned with value judgements, investing in things that have substance. It cultivates sensual pleasures like food, music, and wine. Though resilient, Taurus struggles with change. It clings to familiarity, oftentimes refusing to lower its standards once they’ve been raised.</h1>
