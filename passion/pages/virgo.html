        <h1> Virgo is a Mercury-ruled Mutable Earth sign and the sixth sign of the zodiac. Virgo deals with discernment and helpfulness. Symbolized by the Virgin, Virgo aims for a unique definition of “purity.” It assimilates, digests, and applies information. It diagnoses things, makes things more efficient, and has an overall fixation on quality. Virgo is incredibly skilled and tries to make things that are useful. Detail-oriented and critical, Virgo can struggle with seeing the bigger picture. Its aim towards “purity” can result in a perfectionist nature.</h1>
