        <h1>Sagittarius is a Jupiter-ruled Mutable Fire sign and the ninth sign of the zodiac. Sagittarius deals with inspiration and inclusion. Symbolized by the archer, it shoots towards the horizon of potential and possibility. Sagittarius is defined by big picture thinking and wants everyone to follow along as it moves towards its goal. Sagittarius is free-spirited and empowered by the chase towards something greater. It often holds onto truths that can’t be proven, though, and it can be dogmatic. Sagittarius often struggles to commit to things.</h1>
