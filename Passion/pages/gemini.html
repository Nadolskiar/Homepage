        <h1> Gemini is a Mercury-ruled Mutable Air sign and the third sign of the zodiac. Gemini deals with stimulation and adaptability. Symbolized by the twins, Gemini engages in dialogues with itself and absorbs information from multiple sources. Gemini wants to do everything. Its detail-oriented nature allows it to satisfy its curiosity and understand how things work. Gemini makes connections in order to find solutions. Its desire to stay stimulated can leave it scattered though. Gemini is also prone to instability and volatility, moving too quickly in multiple directions.</h1>
