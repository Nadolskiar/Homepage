        <h1>Libra is a Venus-ruled Cardinal Air sign and the seventh sign of the zodiac. Libra is known for harmony and justice. Symbolized by the scales, it aims to bring environments into stability. Libra initiates conversations, collects opinions, stimulates minds, and understands issues from multiple perspectives. Libra exposes all viewpoints, and when one is lacking, it makes up for that lack by taking on a contrarian stance. Libra is also an aesthetic sign, making places more vibrant and visually cohesive. Though Libra is the judge, it’s not the jury or the executioner. Libra struggles with being decisive, never settling on a single idea or perspective. It can also struggle to follow through with social connections.</h1>
