        <h1> 
Capricorn is a Saturn-ruled Cardinal Earth sign and the tenth sign of the zodiac. Capricorn is known for responsibility and business-like conduct. Symbolized by the goat, Capricorn buckles down and does what needs to be done regardless of obstacles. It puts forethought into things, usually focusing on how to deal with issues while restricted by certain rules. Capricorn tends to represent time and ancient things, sticking to tradition. The Saturnian nature of Capricorn makes it separate itself from others. Its focus on tradition can narrow the lens, making it incapable of seeing how things could improve through change.</h1>
