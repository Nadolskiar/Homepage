        <h1> Pisces is a Jupiter-ruled Mutable Water sign and the twelfth sign of the zodiac. Pisces deals with expansion and idealism. Symbolized by the fish, it sits in an endless expanse of cohesion and inclusion. Pisces aims to connect everyone in a coherent way, even if it means accepting contradictions. Pisces is intuitive, sensing other people’s thoughts and drives, and is willing to sacrifice in the name of the greater good. It gravitates towards the things that fill the void caused by a lack of togetherness. The sensitivity of Pisces can cause it to take in too much, though, and its lack of boundaries leaves it struggling to adjust to existing structures.</h1>
