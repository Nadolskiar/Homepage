Symbolized by the scorpion, it is both armored and armed, capable of standing on the offensive and the defensive. Scorpio undergoes intense transformation and can withstand being in harsh environments. It’s able to get to the bottom of issues and uncover secrets. It also has a bottomless well of emotional depth, feeling things with an intensity that cannot be dismissed. Though it’s able to uncover secrets, Scorpio holds many secrets of its own.
